Diabetes is a metabolic disorder due to insufficient or less activity of pancreas secretion’s insulin hormone in human physique. In the long term, uncontrolled diabetes
affects the eyes, kidneys, heart, and even the nervous system of the human body. Diabetes creates an eye disease called Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). In the future, it will
cause permanent blindness if not treated in the early stage of DR. Poor control of glucose levels in the blood enhances the DR, then the well-maintained blood glucose levels.
DR is one of the important causes of permanent blindness of the eyes. One-third
number of diabetic patients come under DR, and one-tenth of them face the severity of
permanent vision loss. Twenty to seventy-year-old people lose their vision mainly due
to DR in USA. Therefore, regular, at least annual retina screening is necessary.
